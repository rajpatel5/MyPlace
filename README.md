# MyPlace

This app helped place me in the top 5 for the HackTheValley hackathon. A simple app created for the use of new home owners to help them visualize what their new homes can look like with the choice of furniture and appliances. This app offers life-like models which can be moved around on-screen and be placed in any position. It also offers the ability to take a picture of the model in its postion.

The app was coded in Java using Android Studio. It uses Google's ARCore library for the augmented reality to display the objects in the real world and give the user the ability to move around while anchoring the object in our reality. The models are .obj files. The app uses recyclerviews to create a fresh and beautiful UI. The app also uses a handler thread to offload the processing of the image when a picture has been taken and then stores it in the user's gallery.
